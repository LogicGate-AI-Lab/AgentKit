## Abstract Summary
The study investigates the impact of weather variables on Islamic stock indices in New York and London. Key findings include:
- Abnormal deviations in weather (e.g., cloud cover in New York, wind speed in London) significantly affect Dow Jones Islamic Indices.  
- A "Monday effect" (calendar anomaly) is observed in the studied indices.  
- Dynamic lead-lag relationships exist between weather variables and market indices.  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks provide accurate forecasts for these indices.
